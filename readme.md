**Be careful**: avoid repetition to existing site/software, i.e. [kahv](https://go.kahv.io/), and can be played/analyzed by corresponding bot/AI

## Usage
### see the static 19x19 boardâ€”â€”run `board.jl` separately
1. download, install and add [julia](https://julialang.org/) into path
2. run julia in your `cmd/shell/terminal` and you will enter `julia-REPL` mode
```shell
cmd> julia 
```  
3. enter `julia-pkg` mode
```julia
julia> ]
```
4. install [PlotlyJS.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/PlotlyJS.jl)
```julia
(@v1.7) pkg> add PlotlyJS
```
5. download `board.jl` file
6. run `board.jl`
```julia
julia> include("path/to/fileName.jl") 
```
### play with KataGo in CLIâ€”â€”run `gtp.jl` separately
1. download a KataGo [release](https://github.com/lightvector/KataGo/releases/) and a [network](https://katagotraining.org/networks) and `gtp.jl`, then put them in one file fold
2. edit the first line of `gtp.jl` to indicate the KataGo release, the newwork and the config 
3. run `gtp.jl`
```shell
cmd> julia gtp.jl 
```
4. wait until
```shell
GTP ready, beginning main protocol loop
```
5. type follow strings to play a Go game
```shell
play B k10
genmove W
showboard
genmove B
play W c3
showboard
...
```
### play with KataGo in VastGoâ€”â€”run `kata_dash.jl` separately
1. run `kata_dash.jl`
```shell
cmd> julia kata_dash.jl
```
2. wait until
```julia
[ Info: Listening on: 0.0.0.0:8050
```
3. open any browser and type `localhost:8050` in the address bar

## Q&A 
- Why running board.jl takes so long? 
  - Julia needs more time to first plot.
  - You can use [sysimage](https://julialang.github.io/PackageCompiler.jl/dev/examples/plots.html#examples-plots) to accelerate.
- Why Julia?
  - [Evan Miller](https://www.evanmiller.org/why-im-betting-on-julia.html) 
- Why Plotly(JS) Dash?
  - More interactive features than the others. [Details](https://docs.juliaplots.org/latest/backends/)
