## About

> The repo is about the game of [Go/Baduk/Weiqi](https://www.usgo.org/learn-play), [GoTextProtocol(GTP)](http://www.lysator.liu.se/~gunnar/gtp/), [SmartGameFormat(.sgf)](https://www.red-bean.com/sgf/), [KataGo](https://katagotraining.org/), [Leela-Zero](https://zero.sjeng.org/), [GNU Go](https://www.gnu.org/software/gnugo/), [Julia](https://julialang.org/), [PlotlyJS.jl](https://plotly.com/julia/), [Dash.jl](https://dash-julia.plotly.com/), [Markdown](https://commonmark.org/), [ScalableVectorGraphics(.svg)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG), [Regular Expression](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/grep.php), etc.

VastGo is
- A cross-platform Go GUI that can run on Windows, Linux, Android and perhaps FreeBSD, MacOS, IOS, HarmonyOS. 
- Based on Dash.jl, PlotlyJS.jl, JSON.jl and modern or classic GTP engines.
- Written in pure julia and under the MIT [license](#license).

Top-level design:
```
            DATA
Players <<<======>>> components
             ||          /\
            c||b         ||
            a||a        c||b
            l||c        a||a
            l||k        l||c
             ||s        l||k
             ||          ||s
             \/          ||
          functions <<<======>>> Bots
                        DATA
```

Several ideas:

Ideas | Details
--- | ---
funny | non-standard Go , *BEAT AI RIGHT NOW*
green | use playtime data to first review, *LESS EXCESSIVE COMPUTING LESS COâ‚‚* 
simple | don't know Go, use GTP command `showboard`, *LESS CODE LESS GOTCHA*
useful | rich and powerful plot: move-score-tree curve, 3D ownership, spline... line style, f'(x), f"(x)

## Why create this?

genmove W
showboard
genmove B
play W c3
showboard
...
final_score
quit
```
</details>

<details>
  <summary>play with KataGo in browserâ€”â€”run kata_dash.jl</summary>

1. run `kata_dash.jl`
```shell
cmd> julia kata_dash.jl
```
2. wait until
```julia
[ Info: Listening on: 0.0.0.0:8050
```
3. open one(**only one**) browser and type `localhost:8050` in the address bar

## Q&A 
- Why running board.jl takes so long? 
  - Julia needs more time to first plot.
  - You can use [sysimage](https://julialang.github.io/PackageCompiler.jl/dev/examples/plots.html#examples-plots) to accelerate.
- Why Julia?
  - [Evan Miller](https://www.evanmiller.org/why-im-betting-on-julia.html) 
- Why Plotly(JS) Dash?
  - More interactive features than the others. [Details](https://docs.juliaplots.org/latest/backends/)
