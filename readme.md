## How to run "board.jl"?
1. download and install [julia](https://julialang.org/) 
2. run julia in your cmd/shell/terminal and you will enter julia-REPL mode
```shell
cmd> julia 
```  
3. enter julia-pkg mode
```julia
julia> ]
```
4. install [PlotlyJS.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/PlotlyJS.jl)
```julia
(@v1.6) pkg> add PlotlyJS
```
5. download board.jl file
6. run board.jl
```julia
julia> include("path/to/fileName.jl") 
```

## Q&A 
- Why running board.jl takes so long? 
  - Julia needs more time to first plot.
  - You can use [sysimage](https://julialang.github.io/PackageCompiler.jl/dev/examples/plots.html#examples-plots) to accelerate.
- Why Julia?
  - [Evan Miller](https://www.evanmiller.org/why-im-betting-on-julia.html) 
- Why Plotly(JS) Dash?
  - More interactive features than the others. [Details](https://docs.juliaplots.org/latest/backends/)
